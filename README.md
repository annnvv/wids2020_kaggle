# WIDS2020 Datathon Kaggle Competition

According to WIDS: "The challenge is to create a model that uses data from the first 24 hours of intensive care to predict patient survival. MIT's GOSSIS community initiative, with privacy certification from the Harvard Privacy Lab, has provided a dataset of more than 130,000 hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) visits from patients, spanning a one-year timeframe. This data is part of a growing global effort and consortium spanning Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Brazil, and more than 200 hospitals in the United States."

Purpose: This repository is for the data cleaning and modeling work done for the WIDS 2020 Kaggle challenge. 

Workflow:
1. EDA for train data
2. Cleaning train and test data
3. Modeling:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree (CART)
* K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM) Radial
* Random Forest
* XGBoost
* Naive Bayes

4. Ensemble Modeling:
* Random Forest
* XGBoost
* Support Vector Machine (SVM) Radial
* Support Vector Machine (SVM) Linear
